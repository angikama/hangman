# Hangman
## Milestone 1
- This code defines a list of words and chooses a random word from the list, it then asks the user for input and checks whether the input is valid
  - The variable created is called word list, with 5 names of fruits
  - The 'random' module is used to give us a random choice from the list
  - The input from the user must be a single letter for it to be a good guess, if not the message "Oops! That is not a valid input." is shown
